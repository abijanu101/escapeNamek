# escapeNamek

I was assigned **a Flappy Bird Clone in Assembly Language** for the **Intel 8086** as a part of my project for a course at my university (_"Computer Organization & Assembly Language"_). The game is themed around the anime _Dragon Ball Z_, specifically goku's escape from the remains of Planet Namek after the iconic fight with Freeza.

### Features:
- Intro Screen
- Physics, Jumping, Collision Detection, Height Limit
- Pausing
- Game Over Menu and Score Tracking
- _i also made all of the visuals myself (including the pixel art)_

### Notable Characteristics:
- The Retro 0x13 Graphic Mode is Used
- A set of .bmp images with bit-depth 8 (indexed color), having a shared palette are read from into a buffer and drawn on the screen
- A bright green color is used as a placeholder for transparency
- ISR's from the IVT are hooked onto and unhooked as required to ensure keyboard control and score tracking.
