This is a Dragon Ball Z Themed Flappy Bird Clone in Assembly Language for the Intel 8086. This was a part of a GROUP PROJECT for the course, "Computer Organization & Assembly Language" at my university, but i did basically everything so i feel comfortable posting this on my own github.

### Features:
- Menus
- File Handling (learned .bmp's for this)
- Basic Functionality
- Pausing
- i also made all of the visuals myself (including the pixel art)
